# Game-of-Life-with-Genetic-Programming
In this repo I show an example of how Genetic Programming can be applied to infer the rules of Conway's Game of Life.

### learning_the_life.ipynb

In this Jupyter Notebook I define my standard Game of Life and I try to understand what are the main issues about learning the rules behind the simulation.

Here, you can compare the handcrafted version with the learned one and make some animations.

### conway_background.ipynb

Here, I've played a bit with one of the models I've obtained to reverse-simulate the GoL over a Conway's picture.

### speeding_the_life.ipynb

Here, I've sped up a bit my classes in order to compute faster the function "step" and I've analyzed the execution time.

### utils.py

Here, you can find all the functions you need to run the Jupyter notebooks.

### classes_games.py

Here, you can find all the classes I've used to make my experiments.
