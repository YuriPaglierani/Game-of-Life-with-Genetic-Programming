# Game-of-Life-with-Genetic-Programming
In this repo I show an example of how Genetic Programming can be applied to infer the rules of Conway's Game of Life.

### learned_game_of_life.ipynb

In this Jupyter Notebook I define my standard Game of Life and I try to understand what are the main issues about learning the rules behind the simulation.

Here, you can compare the handcrafted version with the learned one and make some animations.
